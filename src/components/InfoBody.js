It hosts weather patterns that range from Arctic to moderate, from seemingly endless rains to drought, from numbing cold to heat waves. With all those landforms and weather types, the possibilities of severe weather and geological events are a constant reality. <br /> <br /> Some of the most destructive hazards are in the form of natural disasters such as Avalanches, Earthquakes, Floods, Hurricanes, Tornados, Tsunamis, and Wildfires.</h3>
